            Hi! My name is Sean, and I am a web development bootcamp student. I'm currently learning programming languages such as HTML, CSS, and Javascript through Rutgers University and plan to graduate in July. While I am new to the field, I am excited to continue learning and grow as a developer!

            I currently live in southern New Jersey. Hobbies include music, film, photography, and disc golf. More content to come...
