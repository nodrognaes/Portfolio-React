              Hi! My name is Sean, and I am a full-stack web developer with a specific interest in web design. I'm a recent graduate of a coding bootcamp program through Rutgers University where I created web applications using CSS, Javascript, MERN, etc. While I am new to the field, I am excited to continue learning and growing as a developer!
